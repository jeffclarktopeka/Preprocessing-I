            <h3>A Little Info About Me</h3>
            <p>the name is Peter Parker. I am from New York City, New York. I was born to my loving parents Richard and Mary Parker in 1993. At the age of 6 my parents were killed in a plane crash forcing me to move in with my Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I was highly educated in high school and even made the high honors, which made me a bit of an outcast. While attending a public event hosted by the "General Techtronics Corporation" demonstrating the safe removal of nuclear waste I was bitten by a radiated spider which gave me many super powers. It was then I became your friendly, neighborhood Spiderman</p>
